## üìö Projects Overview

### Python Fundamentals

* **[python-hello_world](./python-hello_world/)** - Introduction to Python programming
  * Basic syntax and print functions
  * String manipulation and formatting
  * Variables and data types
  * Python philosophy (The Zen of Python)

* **[python-if_else_loops_functions](./python-if_else_loops_functions/)** - Control structures and functions
  * Conditional statements (if/else)
  * Loops (for, while)
  * Function creation and usage
  * String operations and ASCII manipulation

* **[python-import_modules](./python-import_modules/)** - Modules and command line arguments
  * Importing modules and functions
  * Creating and using custom modules
  * Command line arguments handling
  * Variable scope and namespaces

## üéØ Learning Objectives

### Programming Fundamentals

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Python 3.x** - Primary programming language
* **Git** - Version control system
* **Linux/Unix** - Development environment
* **Shell/Bash** - Command line operations

## üìã Requirements

* Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or compatible Linux distribution
* Python 3.8 or higher
* Git for version control
* Text editor or IDE (VS Code, Vim, etc.)

## üöÄ Getting Started
