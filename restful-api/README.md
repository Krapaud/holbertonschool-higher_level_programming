# RESTful API Project

## Introduction
In the evolving world of software development, understanding how to communicate and transfer data efficiently between systems is essential. This project delves into the domain of RESTful APIs, a cornerstone in the realm of web services.

## Learning Objectives
- **HTTP/HTTPS Basics**: Grasp the foundational principles of the web's primary protocol
- **API Consumption with Command Line**: Hands-on experience with curl
- **API Consumption with Python**: Leverage Python's capabilities for data manipulation
- **API Development with http.server**: Understand the basics of API development
- **API Development with Flask**: Advanced API development with Flask framework
- **API Security & Authentication**: Protect data transfer and ensure authorized access
- **API Standards & Documentation**: Maintain standardized documentation with OpenAPI
