# Python - Serialization

This directory contains exercises on serialization and marshaling in Python, exploring different data formats and techniques.

## Project Description

This project focuses on understanding and implementing serialization concepts:
- Basic JSON serialization
- Pickle serialization for custom objects
- CSV to JSON conversion
- XML serialization and deserialization

## Files

- `task_00_basic_serialization.py` - Basic JSON serialization module
- `task_01_pickle.py` - Pickle serialization for custom classes
- `task_02_csv.py` - CSV to JSON conversion
- `task_03_xml.py` - XML serialization and deserialization
- `main_*.py` - Test files for each task
- `data.csv` - Sample CSV data for testing

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the differences between marshaling and serialization
- Implement serialization in practical programming tasks
- Work with different data formats (JSON, XML, CSV)
- Handle exceptions and error cases in serialization
